## fv1-oled-bank-controller

Arduino sketch that drives a 128x64 SSD1306 OLED, reads a rotary encoder, selects FV-1 presets via 3 digital lines, switches external ROM banks by button, and outputs three PWM control signals from pots.

### Features
- Encoder navigation for 8 presets per bank
- Button to cycle 3 banks
- SSD1306 I2C UI with titles, subtitles, and 3 parameter labels
- Three PWM outputs from analog inputs
- 3-bit preset select lines for external hardware
- Preset label text stored in flash (PROGMEM)

### Hardware
- Arduino Uno or compatible ATmega328P board  
- SSD1306 128x64 OLED on I2C (address 0x3C)  
- Rotary encoder with push button  
- Three potentiometers for control inputs  
- External FV-1 hardware or selector that reads the 3-bit preset and bank control pins

### Libraries
Install via Arduino Library Manager:
- Encoder (Paul Stoffregen)
- Adafruit GFX Library
- Adafruit SSD1306  
`Wire`, `avr/io`, and `avr/pgmspace` are part of the AVR core.

### Build and upload
